# Feature Matching & Homography Estimation

## Overview
This project focuses on feature detection, matching, and homography estimation using computer vision techniques. It includes algorithms for identifying and matching features between images and estimating planar homographies to align images for augmented reality applications.

## Key Features
- **Feature Detection and Description**: Implements FAST corner detection and BRIEF descriptors for efficient and accurate feature extraction.
- **Feature Matching**: Matches features across images using descriptor comparisons and a ratio test for robust results.
- **Homography Estimation**: Computes planar homographies based on matched feature correspondences using Direct Linear Transform (DLT) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).
- **Image Warping and Alignment**: Uses homography matrices to warp images, enabling seamless alignment.
- **Augmented Reality Integration**: Projects 3D models onto 2D scenes to simulate augmented reality effects.

## Methodology
1. **Feature Detection**
   - Uses FAST (Features from Accelerated Segment Test) for corner detection.
   - Computes binary descriptors with BRIEF (Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features) for efficient matching.

2. **Feature Matching**
   - Matches descriptors using the ratio test to ensure reliable correspondences.
   - Filters out ambiguous matches to improve accuracy.

3. **Homography Computation**
   - Employs Direct Linear Transform (DLT) to estimate homography matrices.
   - Refines results with RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) to handle outliers.

4. **Planar Homographies**
   - Aligns images based on planar transformations.
   - Warps images using the computed homography matrix for applications such as panoramic stitching and augmented reality.

5. **Augmented Reality Integration**
   - Projects 3D objects onto 2D image planes using computed homographies.
   - Simulates realistic overlays for enhanced visualization.
